# Cord

Cord is a data streaming platform for composing, aggregating and distributing arbitrary streams. It uses a publish-subscribe model that allows multiple publishers to share their streams via a broker. Subscribers can then compose custom sinks using a regex-like pattern to access realtime data based on their individual requirements.

Cord has a programmable interface in the form of the [Client library](client/), so it can be adapted to various use cases. As the library matures, this library will form the basis of a suite of adaptors for common technologies.

## Usage

The easiest way to get up and running is by using the Client CLI. In most production scenarios, you would implement the Client library independently.

#### 1. Start a new broker instance

By default, the `--bind-address` is _127.0.0.1_, and the `--port` is _7101_.

    $ ./server &

#### 2. Subscribe to an arbitrary namespace

In this example, we will subscribe to the `/names` namespace.

    $ ./cord sub /names

Whenever a new event is published under this namespace, it will be printed to stdout.

#### 3. Publish to this namespace

First, declare that you will provide the `/names` namespace.

    $ ./cord pub /names

Next, enter key-value pairs into the console, using the format `NAMESPACE=VALUE`. For example:

> /names=pete  
> /names/fictional=Homer Simpson

## Modules

Cord comprises a number of modules:

-   **[Client](client/)** - provides a library and CLI for interacting with Cord brokers
-   **[Message](message/)** - provides the core `Message` enumerator and codec for sending `Message`s between brokers and clients
-   **[Pattern Matcher](pattern-matcher/)** - provides the algorithm for comparing namespace patterns
-   **[Pub/Sub](pubsub/)** - provides a `Publisher` and `Subscriber` to represent the stream and sink components of a client connection within a broker
-   **[Server](server/)** - the server binary that aggregates and distributes arbitrary streams
